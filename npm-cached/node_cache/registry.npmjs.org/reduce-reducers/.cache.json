Technically works with any reducer, not just with Redux, though I don't know of any other use cases.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"acdlite","email":"acdlite@me.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-02-02T19:56:14.901Z","created":"2015-07-02T00:09:07.123Z","0.1.0":"2015-07-02T00:09:07.123Z","0.1.1":"2015-07-02T05:38:34.099Z","0.1.2":"2016-02-02T19:56:14.901Z"},"keywords":["reduce","reducers","functional","fp","redux"],"author":{"name":"Andrew Clark","email":"acdlite@me.com"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/acdlite/reduce-reducers","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/acdlite/reduce-reducers.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/acdlite/reduce-reducers/issues"},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"56b109de-1517\"","_lastModified":"Tue, 02 Feb 2016 19:56:14 GMT"}
