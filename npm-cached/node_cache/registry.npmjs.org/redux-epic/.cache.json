Redux-Epic\n\n[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/BerkeleyTrue/redux-epic.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)\n\n> Better async in Redux with SSR data pre-fetching\n\nRedux-Epic is a library built to do complex/async side-effects and\nserver side rendering(SSR) data pre-fetching using RxJS.\n\n#### NOTE: \nWith the release of RxJS@5, I'm recommending everyone move to [redux-observable](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable). This library will soon be deprecated as soon as the API is close enough to make the transition easier. With this latest release, we change the API of epics (in a non-breaking way) to make the signatures the same as redux-observable epics. \n\nThe last piece of the puzzle is SSR. I've created [react-redux-epic](https://github.com/BerkeleyTrue/react-redux-epic) to add SSR to Redux Observable in the same fashion as Redux-Epic. \n\n## Current Async story in Redux\n\nThere are currently two different modes of handling side-effects in Redux. The\nfirst is to dispatch actions that are functions or actions that contain some sort\nof data structure. Here are some common examples:\n\n* [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk): dispatch action creators (functions) instead of plain action objects\n* [redux-promise](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-promise): dispatch promises(or actions containing promises) that are converted to actions\n\nThe downside of these two libraries: you are no longer dispatching plain\nserializable action objects.\n\nThe second and cleaner mode is taken by [redux-saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga).\nYou create sagas (generator functions) and the library converts those sagas to redux middleware.\nYou then dispatch actions normally and the sagas react to those actions.\n\n## Redux-Epic makes async better\n\nWhile Redux-Saga is awesome and a source of inspiration for this library,\nI've never been sold on generators themselves. They are a great way to create\nlong lived iterables (you pull data out of them), it just doesn't make sense\nwhen you want something to push data to you instead. Iterables (generators create iterables)\nare by definition not reactive but interactive. They require something to be\nconstantly polling (pulling data out) them until they complete.\n\nOn the other hand, Observables are reactive! Instead of polling the iterable, we\njust wait for new actions from our observables and dispatch as normal.\n\n## Why create Redux-Epic?\n\n* Observables are powerful and proven\n    * Allows Redux-Epic to offer a smaller API surface\n    * Allows us to easily do server side rendering with data pre-fetching\n\n* The Epic approach is a cleaner API\n  * Action creators are plain map functions. In other words, they take in data\n    and output actions\n  * Components are can be plain mapping functions. Take in data and output html.\n  * Complex/Async application logic lives in epics.\n\n* Server Side Rendering depends on async side-effects, which is why it's built into\n  Redux-Epic\n\nObservables offer a powerful and functional API. With Redux-Epic we take\nadvantage of this built in power and leave our specific API as small as\npossible.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save redux-epic\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nLet's create a Epic, a function that returns an observable stream of actions,\nthat handles fetching user data\n\n```js\n// fetch-user-epic.js\nimport { Observable } from 'rx';\nimport fetchUser from 'my-cool-ajax-library';\n\nexport default function tickEpic(actions$) {\n  return action$\n    // only listen for the action we care about\n    // this will be our trigger\n    .filter(action.type === 'FETCH_USER')\n    .flatMap(action => {\n      const userId = action.payload;\n      // fetchUser makes an ajax request and returns an observable\n      return fetchUser(`/api/user/${userId}`)\n        // turn the result of the ajax request\n        // into an action\n        .map(user => { return { type: 'UPDATE_USER', payload: { user: user } }; })\n        // handle request errors with another action creator\n        .catch(error => Observable.just({ type: 'FETCH_USER_ERROR', error: error }));\n    });\n}\n```\n\nNow to start using your newly created epic:\n\n```js\nimport { createEpic } from 'redux-epic';\nimport { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'\nimport myReducer from './my-reducer'\nimport fetchUserEpic from './fetch-user-epic'\n\n// createEpic can take any number of epics\nconst epicMiddleware = createEpic(fetchUserEpic);\n\nconst store = createStore(\n  myReducer,\n  applyMiddleware(epicMiddleware);\n);\n\n```\n\nAnd that's it! Your epic is now connected to redux store.\nNow to trigger your epic, you just need to dispatch the\n'FETCH_USER' action!\n\n## [Docs](docs)\n\n* [API](docs/api)\n* [recipes](docs/recipes)\n\n## Previous Art\n\nThis library is inspired by the following\n\n* [Redux-Saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga): Sagas built using generators\n* [Redux-Saga-RxJS](https://github.com/salsita/redux-saga-rxjs): Sagas using RxJS (No longer maintained)\n\n## Redux-Observable\n\nIt's come to my attention the recent changes to the library [redux-observable](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable).\n\nInitially redux-observable was very different from redux-epic. They took the same path as redux-thunk, redux-promise, and others where the observable (or promise, or function, or whatever) goes through the dispatch. This was distasteful to me, which is why I went the same route as redux-saga and redux-saga-rxjs, using middleware to intercept and dispatch actions in a fashion that fits the idioms of both Redux and Rx.\n\nIt looks like they independently came to the same conclusion in https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/pull/55 and https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/pull/67 and switched to an identical model as mine, even the same name! It's great that we both came to the same conclusions and validates my initial thoughts.\n\nAfter a conversation with the authors of Redux-Observable, we've decided to join\nforces. More details to come as to exactly how that would work.\n\nI recommend using Redux-Observable over this library unless you need server side\ndata fetcing today.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"berkeleytrue","email":"berkeley@r3dm.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-05-05T00:28:01.540Z","created":"2016-04-26T05:38:11.647Z","0.0.1":"2016-04-26T05:38:11.647Z","0.1.0":"2016-04-26T23:46:34.452Z","0.1.1":"2016-05-04T23:33:34.161Z","0.1.2":"2016-05-05T19:54:46.107Z","0.2.0":"2017-04-12T00:44:55.852Z","0.3.0":"2017-05-05T00:28:01.540Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/BerkeleyTrue/redux-epic#readme","keywords":["redux","react","asynx","rx","rxjs","saga","middleware"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/BerkeleyTrue/redux-epic.git"},"author":{"name":"Berkeley Martinez","email":"Berkeley@RoboTie.com","url":"http://RoboTie.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/BerkeleyTrue/redux-epic/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"590bc711-4e29\"","_lastModified":"Fri, 05 May 2017 00:28:01 GMT"}
